# gym-tracker

Just a fun side project. It will become a gym exercise tracking tool. This repo will be containing the first proof-of-concept.
For now, I will write some notes.

As a gymgoer I want...
- a convenient way to input and customize workouts
  - Using vision AI to import any exercise from other e.g. apps, notes or from paper, would be interesting approach?
  This feature itselfs sounds like a Claude / OpenAI side project, evaluating how good the responses are and dealing with outliers.
- it to be convenient to mark sets + exercises done in the app while at the gym, quickly adjusting rest times and measuring rest times between sets
- it to be easy to maintain a calendar of my workouts
- to maintain multiple workout routines. E.g. person creates a primary gym routine, different kinds of rehab routines and populates two of them into the calendar
- to keep track of exercise consistency

Out of scope:
- Calorie/food tracking
- Sleep tracing, mindfulness
